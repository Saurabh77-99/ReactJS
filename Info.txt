- Reactjs is used to make complex frontend
- At the end it will get compiled in HTML,CSS and Js.

- Most project don't need react in initial phase

# Why Reactjs was created?
- Phantom message problem - Facebook (Notifications & Chat)(show notifications on icon and chat both) 
- No consistency in UI

- State(kind of variable) is managed by JS
- UI managed by DOM
- There should be a talk between JS and DOM (sync)

# React is a Library(freedom)

- Core of React (State or UI manipulation,JSX)
- Component Reusability
- Reusing of Component (Props)
- How to propogate change (hooks) - useState , useEffect
- Single Page Application (SPA)
